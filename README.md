#About
This project is a fork of https://github.com/xLAva/JediAcademyLinux

I have removed the Oculus related code to have a more "clean" version of the single player source.
I have also edited the CMakeFiles to change the of the executables back to the original single player.
I have also removed the mp code, tools, and binary folders.
This version is for me to hack on the Jedi Academy Source Code.
