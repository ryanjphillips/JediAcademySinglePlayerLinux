## About
This project is a fork of https://github.com/xLAva/JediAcademyLinux

## Notes
* Fixed compilation errors with newer C++ standard.
* I have removed the Oculus related code to have a more "clean" version of the single player source.
* I have also edited the CMakeFiles to change the name of the executables back to the original single player.
* I have also removed the multi-player code, tools, and binary folders.
* This version is for me to hack on the Jedi Academy singleplayer source code.
